Cost analysis:
Each page hit might find 10 uncached videos. Assuming 20 youtube page hits a day,
we do 200 requests/day.

Using stats from our dataset, we can expect 6k tokens (input+output) per 200 requests.
The fine-tuned ada model costs .16 cents per 1k tokens, so the extension costs about 1 cent
a day.

Zipping the extension:

```bash
zip chrome.zip -xcvf chrome-extension/*
```
